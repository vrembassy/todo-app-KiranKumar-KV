1)		As I understood, IIFE helps in avoiding over populating the global namespace. I tired declaring global variables inside the IIFE function as below
				
				(function(){
					var itemsArray = [];
					var index = 0;
				})();
				
		But the itemsArray and index was still inaccessible. inorder to use them, I had to wrap all the other functions inside the IIFE as shown below
		
			(fucntion(){
				var itemsArray = [];
				var index = 0;
				
				function check(){.....}
				function someFunction(){....}
			})();
			
		Is this the correct way to do it? Because I'm not finding myself comfortable with wrapping all the functions inside one outer function.
